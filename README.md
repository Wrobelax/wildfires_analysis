**Project status**: In progress - visualisation.

This project is a data analysis of a publicly available data from: 
https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/Data%20Files/Historical_Wildfires.csv

The project consists of data analysis and data modeling of historical wildfires in Australia by using Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy Python libraries. 
All data was pushed and managed on Github via Git bash. The data did not require cleaning so this step was omitted.


**Structure of the project is as follows:**


_Folder "data":_
- "Historical_wildfires" : File with input data used for analysis.


_Folder "scripts":_
- "data_cleaning.py" : Python file used for data cleaning, basic exploration of data and generating 'dleaned_data.csv'.
- "data_visualisation.py" : Python file used to create visualisations and generate output files.
